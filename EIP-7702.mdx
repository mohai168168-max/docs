Stable supports **EIP-7702**, introducing a unified account model where EOAs (externally-owned accounts) can temporarily operate as smart accounts.

**Key behavior:**

- Users sign transactions with their existing keys
- Execution can incorporate contract-like logic without permanent account upgrade
- Enables secure authorization flows for payments and custody
- Improves UX for wallets and merchants using USDT

**Developer implication:**

- Users gain contract-grade functionality without deploying new contracts, reducing onboarding friction and simplifying custody.
