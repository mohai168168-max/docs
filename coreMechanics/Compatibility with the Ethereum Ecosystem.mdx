Stable is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to use familiar tools, libraries, and contract patterns without modification. This ensures seamless migration of existing applications and straightforward onboarding for teams already building in the Ethereum ecosystem.

**Key Compatibility Features**

- **Languages**: Supports Solidity and Vyper for smart contract development.
- **Tooling**: Works out of the box with standard frameworks such as Hardhat and Foundry.
- **Libraries**: Fully compatible with ethers.js, web3.js, and other common JSON-RPC clients.
- **Contract Patterns**: Adheres to standard EVM conventions, including ERC-20 approvals, event emission, and access-control mechanisms.
- **RPC Interface**: Exposes the same JSON-RPC methods used by Ethereum networks, enabling existing integrations and indexers to function without code changes.
