title: "Finality Rules & Compatibility Guarantees"

Stable processes transactions within an EVM-based execution environment. When a transaction is included in a block, its effects are applied to state and become immediately visible to applications, contracts, and indexers.

## Execution Confirmation
A transaction is considered **confirmed** once:

- It is successfully included in a produced block
- State changes (balances, storage, events) can be observed through RPC

During the public testnet phase:

- Confirmed state should be treated as valid for application logic
- Monitoring systems should be used to track block continuity

## Settlement Considerations

Stable provides single-slot finality, meaning transactions are finalized as soon as they are included in a valid block.

**For developers, this ensure:**

- Once a transaction appears in a confirmed block, its state changes are final and irreversible.
- Applications can safely rely on block inclusion as confirmation of settlement.

**Even with deterministic finality, applications handling financially sensitive flows should:**

- Verify transaction success via RPC or emitted events before proceeding with dependent actions (e.g., unlocks, redemptions).
- Implement retry and reconciliation logic for automation and batch operations to handle transient submission or RPC errors.

## Compatibility Commitments

Stable intends to maintain a consistent execution surface for developers throughout testnet growth phases.

**Current commitments:**

- Published system module interfaces and execution behavior will remain stable unless explicitly noted
- Any potentially disruptive changes will be:
  - Announced in advance
  - Documented in the Release & Change Log
  - Accompanied by migration instructions when necessary

Future updates will introduce:

- A formal compatibility policy
- Change-level classification for developer-facing features
- Clear handling guidance for version transitions
