Stable uses a single-component gas fee model:

- **No priority tip (maxPriorityFeePerGas is ignored)**
- Fees are based purely on base execution cost
- Fees are paid in **gUSDT**

Rationale:

- Stable removes fee volatility for predictable payments
- Eliminates user confusion around “tips” and miner incentives

Developer impact:

- Developers must not rely on **priority fees** for transaction acceleration
- Wallets should hide or disable tip input fields
- Gas estimation tooling must reference Stable RPC pricing logic
