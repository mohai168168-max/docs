## General
**What is Stable?**

Stable is a high-performance blockchain meticulously designed to become the dedicated home for USDT, poised to revolutionize how USDT moves globally.

**What makes Stable different from other blockchains?**

Stable is a high-performance network designed specifically for USDT. It provides a variety of USDT-specific features, including using USDT as the native gas token, guaranteed blockspace, and aggregated USDT0 transfers, all supported by a highly scalable architecture.

## Technical Features

**What approach does Stable use to improve scalability?**

Stable takes a full-stack approach and upgrades every stage of the transaction lifecycle, from the state database, execution, and consensus to USDT-specific optimizations.

**Is it possible for Stable to adopt DAG through a future consensus upgrade?**

Yes. Unlike Narwhal & Tusk, which is not directly compatible with StableBFT, Autobahn offers a PBFT-on-DAG architecture that integrates more naturally with Stable’s consensus layer.

**Is Stable EVM-compatible? Can dapps be ported from other EVM ecosystem?**
Yes. Stable is fully EVM-compatible, allowing users and developers to seamlessly interact with the chain using existing Ethereum contracts, tools, and wallets.

## USDT Features

**What is the difference between USDT0 and gUSDT?**

Both USDT0 and gUSDT are pegged 1:1 to the value of USDT, but they serve different purposes. USDT0 is an ERC-20 token that follows LayerZero’s OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token) standard and serves as the core asset on the Stable network. In contrast, gUSDT is used as the native gas token on Stable and is primarily intended for paying transaction fees.

Just as ETH is used for gas and wETH for ERC-20 interactions, gUSDT acts as the native asset on Stable, while USDT0 ensures compatibility with smart contracts.

**How can I get USDT0 & gUSDT on Stable?**
- USDT0: Thanks to USDT0’s OFT standard, users can easily onboard their USDT0 holdings from other networks to Stable via LayerZero.
- gUSDT: You can obtain gUSDT by converting USDT0 to gUSDT on Stable with unwrap function, or by enabling the “destination gas convert” feature to automatically receive gUSDT during the LayerZero bridging process.

**What other unique USDT-specific features does Stable have?**

Upcoming features include:
- Guaranteed Blockspace, which allows institutional users to access predictable latency and cost for blockspace usage, regardless of network congestion.
- USDT Transfer Aggregator, which efficiently bundle multiple USDT0 transfer transactions to improve throughput and reduce overhead.
- Confidential Transfer, a feature designed to protect transaction amount privacy while remaining compliant with regulatory requirements.

**What is the Stable Pay?**

The Stable Pay offers a simplified, user-friendly experience with the power of decentralized finance. It’s designed for both beginners and experienced crypto users. Newcomers can easily onboard using features like social login, while existing users can connect their current wallets without any migration. Available on web and mobile, Stable ensures secure access to digital assets anytime, anywhere.
