Welcome to the official documentation for **Stable**.

With over $190 billion in circulation and more than 350 million users globally, USDT leads the stablecoin market, powering centralized exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi), and international payments. Yet, current infrastructure struggles to meet increasing demands for lower costs, higher speeds, and greater reliability.

Stable addresses these demands through a scalable, secure, and user-friendly blockchain specifically crafted for USDT’s practical needs. Whether serving retail users in emerging markets or financial institutions handling substantial transaction volumes, Stable delivers an optimal environment to make transactions faster, cheaper, and significantly more efficient.

Stable allows this with a high-throughput Layer 1 blockchain with sub-second finality, designed to serve as the asset issuance and settlement layer for USDT. Some of the key features include:


- **Optimized for USDT:** Stable provides comprehensive USDT-focused features including optimized large scale USDT transfers and efficient USDT issuance and settlement capabilities.
- **Built for Everyday Usage:** Transactions finalize in under a second with minimal costs. Stable’s intuitive wallet simplifies sending, receiving, and asset management while enabling easy debit and credit card integrations.
- **Custom features for Enterprise:** Stable provides advanced features designed for institutional needs. It offers guaranteed blockspace allocation, efficient USDT transaction processing, high throughput capabilities with transfer aggregation, and comprehensive security measures. The platform also includes confidential transfer features that balance privacy with regulatory compliance.
