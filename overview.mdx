Stable exposes core settlement behavior through **System Modules**, implemented as **precompiled contracts** for gas efficiency and predictable control.

**Key modules:**

- Bank Module
  - Handles USDT transfers, balance accounting, and escrow flows
- Distribution Module
  - Fee distribution and reward logic for network participants
- Staking Module
  - Controls validator participation and staking (coming with mainnet)


**DApps can leverage built-in modules instead of re-implementing token or settlement logic.**
