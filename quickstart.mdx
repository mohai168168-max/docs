## 1. Network Endpoints & RPC

Stable exposes standard JSON-RPC methods compatible with common EVM developer tooling.

RPC access is used for:

- Reading network state
- Sending transactions
- Retrieving logs and events
- Estimating execution cost

RPC details: [JSON RPC API](/coreMechanics/JSON-RPC-API)

## 2. Tooling Setup

Stable supports development with common EVM tooling. This allows teams to use their existing build pipelines.

Supported tools include:

- Solidity compilers
- Hardhat
- Foundry
- ethers.js / web3.js libraries

Basic environment requirements:

- Node.js
- npm or yarn for dependency management
- Access to Stable JSON-RPC endpoint
