Stable is a high-performance blockchain designed to support seamless USDT-based activity. Built on a **delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS)** mechanism, Stable offers **full EVM compatibility** and achieves **sub-second block times** for fast and reliable transaction finality. As a network **dedicated to USDT**, Stable provides a range of USDT-specific features that optimize user experience.

Key features include:

- **Sub-Second Block Finality**: Ensure sub-second block time and single slot finality
- **100% EVM Compatibility**: Supporting Ethereum tooling and smart contracts
- **USDT as Gas Token**: For non-USDT0 transfers, users pay gas fees in USDT0 tokens, which are automatically converted to gUSDT by the bundler and paymaster system
- **Simplified User Experience**: Users only need to hold USDT0 tokens, with the protocol handling all gas token conversions automatically
- **USDT0 Cross-Chain Bridge**: Users can bridge USDT0 from other chains including EVM chains like Ethereum, Arbitrum, HyperEVM, and other chains like Tron
- **Web2.5 UX through Stable Pay**: Seamless user experience provided by Stable Pay

In the future, Stable will introduce additional features to further enhance USDT usability and network efficiency. These include **USDT Transfer Aggregator**, which aggregates multiple USDT-related transactions in a single bundle to improve throughput, and **Guaranteed Blockspace**, a capability designed to help institutions utilize USDT in a predictable and stable environment. Together, these upgrades aim to position Stable as the definitive home for USDT.
