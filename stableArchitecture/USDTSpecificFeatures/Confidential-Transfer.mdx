As blockchain adoption continues to accelerate among enterprises—particularly in the domain of stablecoins—there is an increasing demand for transaction privacy. Businesses often require confidentiality in their financial operations to protect sensitive data such as payment amounts. To address this need, Stable is developing a confidential transfer mechanism that balances the requirement for privacy with the imperatives of regulatory compliance.

Leveraging zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography, Stable is building a confidential transfer layer that enables parties to transfer tokens without disclosing transaction amounts on-chain. While the value of the transfer remains private, sender and recipient addresses remain publicly visible to ensure compliance with financial regulations and auditability.

The shielded transaction values are only accessible to the involved parties and authorized regulatory auditors, ensuring that privacy does not come at the cost of legal transparency.
