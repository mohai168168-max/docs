## USDT-Specific Features

Stable is a dedicated Layer 1 network tailored for USDT. Every component of the protocol is designed to minimize friction in USDT transfers and provide a streamlined, high performance environment tailored to the world’s most widely used stablecoin.

In addition to core infrastructure, Stable offers a range of USDT-specific features that enhance the overall user experience:

- **USDT as Gas Token**: For non-USDT0 transfers, users pay gas fees in USDT0 tokens, which are automatically converted to gUSDT by the bundler and paymaster system
- **Guaranteed Blockspace**: Guaranteed Blockspace is a dedicated blockspace allocation model designed to guarantee enterprises a fixed share of block capacity, allowing them to process transactions with predictable latency and cost.
- **USDT Transfer Aggregator**: A specialized mechanism that isolates and aggregates USDT0 transfers to maximize throughput without compromising fairness or affecting other transactions.
- **Confidential Transfer**: Using ZK cryptography, Stable is planning to enable private USDT transfers where amounts are hidden on-chain while sender and recipient addresses remain visible for regulatory compliance and auditability.
