## Full Stack Core Optimization

<img src="/images/transaction-lifecycle.avif"/>

The lifecycle of a blockchain transaction, from the moment it is submitted to when the result is finalized, passes through multiple tightly connected stages. A transaction is first submitted through the **RPC** interface, added to the **mempool**, packaged into a block, validated through **consensus**, executed by the **state machine**, and finally written to persistent storage in the **database**. Only after completing this full pipeline can the user receive a confirmed result.

Improving just one stage in isolation is not enough. Any inefficiency in the pipeline can impact the overall performance of the system. This is why Stable focuses on optimizing the blockchain stack from top to bottom.

See the following pages to learn how Stable upgrades each layer of its architecture, including Consensus, Execution, Database, and RPC, to ensure reliable and high-performance transaction processing across the network.
