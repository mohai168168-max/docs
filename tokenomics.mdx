Supply, distribution, and economic design of the STABLE token

Stable is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain optimized for stablecoin settlement, enterprise-grade payments, and USDT-centric infrastructure.

This Tokenomics page outlines the supply, distribution, and economic design of the STABLE token.

## Overview

| Item | Details                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Symbol**     | STABLE                    |

STABLE is the governance token of the Stable Mainnet and Ecosystem, designed to support long-term economic alignment across validators, developers, and users.

## Token Allocation

**Total Supply:** 3,000,000,000 STABLE tokens

| Category | Allocation | Amount of STABLE|
| -------- | -----------|-----------------|
|**Investors & Advisors**|    45%    | 1,350,000,000 |
|**Team**|    20%    | 600,000,000 |
|**Ecosystem & Community**|    25%    |750,000,000|
|**Genesis Distribution**    |10%    |300,000,000|
|**Total**    |100%    |3,000,000,000|

## Emission Model & Supply Schedule

- Total supply is fixed at 100,000,000,000 STABLE tokens.
- Only a portion of supply enters circulation at launch of the Stable Mainnet.
- Team and Investor & Advisors allocations are subject to a 4-year linear vesting model, with a 1-year cliff, to ensure long-term commitment.

- Developer grants
- User onboarding incentives
- Payment partner integrations
- On-chain activity rewards
- Hackathons, ambassador programs
- Infrastructure grants

- **Vesting Schedule**

- **Total Vesting Period:** 3-year linear vesting thereafter for the 32% of total supply

### Team - 20% of total token supply

- Allocated to founding team members, engineers, researchers, and contributors
- Designed to ensure long-term alignment between the team and the Stable ecosystem.

- **Vesting Schedule**

## Economic Design Principles

Stable’s token economics were designed around three foundational goals:

### 1. Power a Payments-Optimized Layer 1

The STABLE token incentivizes high-throughput, low-latency infrastructure, supporting sub-second block confirmations and enterprise settlement guarantees.

### 2. Support Sustainable Ecosystem Growth

40% of total token supply is dedicated to long-term growth, focusing on key development and growth areas

- Developer grants
- Partner integrations
- New ecosystem applications

### 3. Align Long-Term Contributors via Vesting

The team allocation uses a 4-year linear vesting model, with a 1-year cliff, ensuring long-term alignment and continued contributions toward network development.

## Utility of the STABLE Token

The STABLE Token is an ERC-20 governance token on the stable mainnet. It can be used for:

- Electing validators
- Voting on protocol upgrades
- Handling governance proposals
- Serving as a credential to receive gas fee distribution from validators

On the Stable Network, all transactions use USDT0 as the native gas token. These USDT0 gas fees are collected into a treasury managed by smart contracts. When token holders stake their STABLE tokens to validators, validators may choose to distribute gas fees from the treasury proportionally to stakers.
