## What is Stable?

Stable is the first Stablechain—a dedicated payments Layer 1 where stablecoins like USDT are used natively for gas and settlement.

## Before Stable

As digital finance accelerates, stablecoins—especially USDT—are becoming central to on-chain activity. However, blockchain infrastructure is not optimized for stablecoin-based operations, leading to several critical challenges

- **Unpredictable and High Fees:** Transaction costs are unpredictable and often spike, rendering frequent small-value transactions costly and impractical.

- **Enterprise Limitations:** Businesses face inconsistent transaction speeds, difficulties integrating blockchain technology with existing systems, and inadequate privacy solutions needed to comply with regulations.

- **Complex User Experience:** Users must manage multiple tokens, including volatile assets required for gas fees, creating a confusing and intimidating environment, particularly for newcomers.

- **Limited Financial Access:** In many underserved regions, access to dollar-based financial tools is limited. High remittance costs further exclude users from participating in digital finance.

- **Developer Obstacles:** The absence of specialized stablecoin infrastructure complicates app development, increasing complexities.

Stable is designed explicitly to overcome these challenges, providing a dedicated blockchain infrastructure optimized for USDT.
